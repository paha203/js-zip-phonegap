  "description":"Hosted by Oliver James, Child\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPsychologist, Author and Broadcaster\nHow can we better engage with the environmental challenges that we are facing? Research shows that people are aware of the issues and may want to do something, but seem to be unable to give up behaviours and habits. This Arena session, curated by Artists Project Earth, will explore how we might overcome our addiction to consuming lifestyles with artists who highlight the issues through a range of media.\nArtists Project Earth has funded over 300 projects and awareness-raising initiatives around the world which combat climate change and develop local resilience and solutions to climate injustice - and gives emergency funding for natural disaster relief. To fund this work APE, in collaboration with international musicians, produces critically acclaimed albums. Ecobuild would like to thank all the participants to this session, who, along with Ecobuild, are supporting the work of Artists Project Earth.",
