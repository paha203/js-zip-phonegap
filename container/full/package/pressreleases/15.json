  "description":"<p>Marley Eternit&rsquo;s Eter-Color fibre cement cladding has been specified for an exciting architectural project on the River Thames, the Sanitov Floating Home.<\/p>\n<p>Showcased in central London this summer, the structure has been designed by Henrik Lambreth, Architect, and Sanitov Studio, a design think tank based in London and Copenhagen that focuses on issues related to urban life and sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Marley Eternit is among the sponsors of the revolutionary floating home, named Inachus after the Greek God of the rivers and water ways, which will be on show at St Katherine&rsquo;s Dock from 14th September &ndash; 23rd September for its official launch as part of the London Design Festival 2012. This follows a preview showing at the London Festival of Architecture back in July.<\/p>\n<p>The lightweight and durable Eter-Color fibre cement panels made them ideal for use on this project, where overall weight was a vital consideration. Eter-Color in Pebble was used on the facade where its attractive surface appearance complimented the other materials used in the construction, including aluminium louvers.<\/p>\n<p>Eter-Color is an exciting range of through coloured architectural fibre cement cladding material from Marley Eternit that&rsquo;s available in eight shades and has a unique surface to create a distinct and aesthetically appealing finish to any building.<\/p>\n<p>The 17m long Inachus floating home has been developed as part of the Sanitov Studio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Urdiamonia&rsquo; project to stimulate a debate about the future of urban living including the need to reintegrate rivers into city life.<\/p>\n<p>Already a highlight of the London Festival of Architecture, Inachus is currently hosting a series of events promoting Danish companies during the Olympics, before featuring at the London Design Festival and then moving to a permanent mooring in Wandsworth.<\/p>\n<p>Jayne Arkell, Commercial Market Manager at Marley Eternit, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to supply this exciting design which is sure to inspire new ideas about city living. We are always interested in working with architects to help them achieve practical and aesthetically pleasing solutions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Oliver Borg von B&uuml;low of the Sanitov Studio said: &ldquo;It was important to use a sustainable cladding material which was lightweight and low maintenance, and which fitted with the aesthetics of the design. Eter-Color fulfilled all of our requirements and its attractive textured surface and range of natural colours made it the ideal choice.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Eter-Color was cut into 300 x 1200mm panels and fitted horizontally with a 5mm gap to harmonise with the shadow lines created by the louvres. Eter-Color was screwed to timber battens fixed to the inner structure using Marley Eternit&rsquo;s colour matched screws.<\/p>\n<p>Marley Eternit&rsquo;s fibre cement rainscreen cladding and overclad solutions contributed to the sustainability of the project because it can achieve an A+ rating as defined in the BRE&rsquo;s Green Guide to Specification based on generic rating for autoclaved fibre cement single sheet - (Element Ref: 80623042, 806230422, 806230447, 806230450).<\/p>\n<p>Eter-Color has EN 13501-1 fire performance and is classified to A2-s1, d0 limited combustibility.<\/p>\n<p>For further information on Eter-Color and Marley Eternit&rsquo;s full range of products and services just ask ME at www.marleyeternit.co.uk\/cladding or call ME on 01283 722588.
