  "title":"Antimicrobial Hygienic Wall Cladding Shows 0 Bacteria in Care Home Tests",
  "description":"<p>Few environments are more hygiene sensitive than Care Homes. The often weakened immune systems of the residents mean extra care is required at every level. The kitchen is potentially a major breeding ground for bacteria such as Salmonella and E.coli and a minor drop in standards can be fatal to patients. Recent tests have demonstrated that antimicrobial wall cladding can virtually eliminate bacteria from walls to minimise the health risks. Microbiologists undertook tests at a UK Care Home where the kitchen was tested for bacteria levels on 35 separate areas ranging from door handles to ceiling tiles. Cultures were incubated in an aerobic environment at 36oC for 48 hours. After incubation, the amount of bacterial growth isolated from each swab was quantified by colony counting and the diversity of growth estimated by inspection of colony types. The swabs taken from the antimicrobial hygienic wall cladding - BioClad, yielded a zero bacteria count. The cladding contains silver ions to create antibacterial protection, this alters the DNA of bacteria and inhibits its ability to replicate. BioClad has previously been tested in laboratory conditions and been found to be effective against MRSA, E.Coli, Salmonella and Influenza A H1N1.<\/p>",
