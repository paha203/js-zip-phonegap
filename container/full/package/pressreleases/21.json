  "description":"<p>Stormsaver are pleased to announce their commercial partnership with Rainwater Harvesting Ltd. The partnership brings together the UK&rsquo;s largest domestic and commercial suppliers for rainwater harvesting systems. The alliance will see commercial jobs being passed to Stormsaver and Stormsaver using selected Rainwater Harvesting products within their domestic systems.<\/p>\n<p>Lisa Farnsworth, Sales Director for Stormsaver highlights, &ldquo;By joining forces with Rainwater Harvesting we will be able to share our expertise and knowledge of commercial systems. Rainwater Harvesting generally focus on smaller domestic systems with tanks ranging from 3-10,000Litres. Our experience with larger, commercial installations means that we will be dealing with the projects they receive which require larger, complex commercial systems. In return, with our domestic projects we are excited to be using some of their products such as the easy to install flat tanks and the HydroForce&trade; submersible pump. We are proud to be associated with Rainwater Harvesting and hope this partnership can really add value to our client base and help the UK to become more proficient in recycling their rainwater&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Rob Cooper, Operations Manager for Rainwater Harvesting Ltd comments, &ldquo;The decision was actually a relatively easy one with both businesses having such a similar ethos, providing high quality and innovative rainwater harvesting systems&rdquo;.<\/p>",
