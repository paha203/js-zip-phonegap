  "title":"Vortice Air Handling Units specified at Gurdwara Temple in Glasgow",
  "description":"<p>Vortice air handling units have been specified at a new Gurdwara Temple in Glasgow. Following its purchase of the Italian air handling expert Loran last year, Vortice has been growing its air handling unit business throughout Europe. Handling air volumes from 80-120,000 cubic metres per hour, the Vortice AHUs are hygiene classified, Eurovent certified and carry the BSEN1886 certification. Every air handling unit is of a bespoke design and build, so the AHU team at Vortice is working closely with architects and design consultants to help specify the right product for their projects.<\/p>\n<p>Mark Mawhinney of Crystal Air said: &ldquo;We chose the air handling units from Vortice because of their outstanding quality and the flexible approach they have when building the units. The new Gurdwara Sikh Temple in Glasgow was the ideal project for us to use these units on and it won&rsquo;t be the last because of the relationship we now have with Vortice.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The air handling unit division at Vortice is headed up by Jon Baron and Technical Manager Mark Cowburn who are both available to offer advice and assistance to architects and specifiers looking at systems suitable for moving between 80-120,000 cubic metres of air per hour. This includes hospitals, food processing units and pharmaceuticals manufacturing because of the high hygiene rating Vortice AHUs offer.<\/p>\n<p>For further information visit www.vortice.ltd.uk<\/p>",
