  "description":"<p>East Midlands Airport now boasts a stunning, new 216-bed Radisson Blu Hotel, featuring energy neutral technology and smooth external contours allowing it to merge with the location while fitting the airports carbon neutral commitment.<\/p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">\n<p>The energy efficient hotel, developed by MAG developments in association with Azure Property Group, symbolises the locality and significance as a gateway to the region, including a courtyard reflecting the nearby National Forest and an aviation style canopy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In order to achieve this, our aluminium systems offer seamless lines with the other elements of the hotel. Energy efficient, three-chamber CS68 thermally broken windows merge vertically with aluminium panels giving an almost aircraft fuselage effect. They perfectly complement the other sustainable products used throughout the build.<\/p>\n<p>Opening up the large internal spaces of the building large sweeps of Reynaers CW50 and CW50 SC offers a seamless wall of glass incorporating automatic Vision 50 doors. This adds to the extremely clean, light and airy internal features of the building.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>",
