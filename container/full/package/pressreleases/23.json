  "title":"Haddonstone launches new TecLite Georgian Door Surround",
  "description":"<p>Haddonstone, the UK&rsquo;s leading landscape ornament and architectural cast stone manufacturer, has launched a new Georgian Door Surround in its revolutionary TecLite material.<\/p>\n<p>The stylish door surround comprises two Tuscan pilasters surmounted by a complementary entablature and is available in five standard colours. It is ideal for retro-fit, new build and refurbishment projects. Along with all Haddonstone products, the Georgian Door Surround is hand-made at the company&rsquo;s purpose built production facility in Northamptonshire.<\/p>\n<p>TecLite is a revolutionary new material and an innovative alternative to TecCast. Although closely resembling traditional cast stone and natural stone in appearance, the use of thin wall construction and GRC technology means a much lower component weight can be achieved.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the door surround, or to request a copy of Haddonstone&rsquo;s inspirational new 204 page catalogue, visit www.haddonstone.com or call 01604 770711.<\/p>",
