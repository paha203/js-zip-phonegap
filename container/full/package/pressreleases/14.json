  "title":"Data Design System (DDS) brings new CAD features for planning PV projects to Ecobuild 2013",
  "description":"<p>Integrated PV project planning is one of the topics at Ecobuild 2013 on Data Design System&rsquo;s (DDS) pod. DDS-CAD PV 8 is the latest stage of development of the PV planning solution. The software provides the user features for project planning, design, visualization, yield estimations and docu-mentation for every step of the PV project.<\/p>\n<p>The software is not only limited to designing PV systems, but also enables further planning of electrical installations. The software allows the user to define circuits, switchboards, instalation systems, cabling, lightning protection systems and monitoring and security systems.<\/p>\n<p>Innovations in the planning functions for on-roof, roof, fa-cade and open field projects are both found in the general handling of the software as in specialized dedicated func-tions. Amongst others, DDS-CAD PV version 8 provides an additional way for considering the horizon line when esti-mating yields of PV systems. The horizon data for each site can now be accessed via the internet and used directly for the simulation.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, DDS-CAD PV 8 also takes into account the reactive power in its calculations, and thus fulfils the current requirements of power supplying companies. A new ap-proach to system design features makes it easier for users to automatically create and edit schematics of planned sys-tems. Moreover, the schematics now provide more informa-tion as compared to the previous version.<\/p>",
