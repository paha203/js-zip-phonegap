  "description":"REHAU Ltd is a leading supplier of polymer-based solutions to construction, REHAU systematically addresses sustainable design priorities by enhancing comfort and convenience, reducing energy costs, creating healthy and safe environments, and conserving finite resources. REHAU\u2019s products and systems for the heating and plumbing, and pipe markets complement each other in integrated solutions that optimise performance.\n\nDistrict heating (DH) is the process of centrally producing heat and distributing the heat via a heat network for space heating and hot water requirements.  In some Scandinavian countries, over 50% of their heat is distributed via district heating schemes.\n\nThe benefits of district heating are increased dramatically by using a combined heat & power plant (CHP), which produces not only heat, but also electricity. CHP plants can be powered by fossil fuels but are increasingly being fuelled by biomass or anaerobic digestion systems.\n\nRAUVITHERM is a pre-insulated PE-Xa pipe for district heating, biomass, biogas and heat pump applications. It has proved immensely popular since its launch due to its high flexibility and easy to use REHAU EVERLOC\u2122 jointing system.\n\nWe will also be exhibting our RAUTHERMEX pre-insulated pipe, Ground-source Probes and our Award winning Ground-air Heat Exchanger AWADUKT Thermo.",

      "description":"AWADUKT Thermo is a ground-air heat exchanger system, also known as earth tubes, for pre-tempering ventilation air. Ventilation air is drawn through underground pipes buried at a depth of 1.5m, which pre-cools the air in the summer and pre-heats it in winter, using the near constant temperature of the ground (7-13\u00b0C).\n\nThe system has been extensively used across the UK in commercial projects, mainly in the education sector. The system is ideally linked up with a mechanical ventilation unit with heat recovery (MVHR) to offer a full ventilation solution."
