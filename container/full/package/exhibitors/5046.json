  "description":"VO4HOME is a British designed, domestic voltage optimisation system that works in homes and small business premises to reduce the incoming voltage supplied to a building. This produces a reduction in energy consumption, savings on electricity bills and reduced wear on appliances. Utilising renowned, award winning technology used on larger scale commercial applications, VO4HOME adopts this for smaller properties. Voltage optimisation is an important technology in the UK, most electrical appliances are rated at 220V, but the average voltage supplied by the national grid is 242V, so in most cases premises are supplied with a higher voltage than is needed.",
