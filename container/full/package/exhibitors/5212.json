  "description":"Stormsaver is the UK's leading supplier of rainwater harvesting systems.\n\nEvery year, Stormsaver delivers more rainwater harvesting systems than any other company.\n\nThe need to capture, store, filter and reuse rainfall is becoming more and more important. As water companies increase their prices and the population grows, demands on mains water continue to rise. Coupled with consumer demand for companies to reduce their environmental impact, rainwater harvesting is increasingly sought after by both the general public and commercial organisations.\n\nRainwater harvesting isn't just about the environment though. Stormsaver's rainwater harvesting systems help companies save money. By capturing, storing and reusing rainfall, Stormsaver clients can save thousands of pounds each year on water bills.",
