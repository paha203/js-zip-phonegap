      "description":"We make no apologies for showing once again our multi-award winning W+W.  Still setting the benchmark for the bathroom industry in terms of eco-credentials, this all-in-one WC and washbasin has been designed to maximize space and conserve water.  Incorporating Roca\u2019s innovative \u2018water-reuse\u2019 technology, the W+W uses waste water from the basin to fill the WC cistern, thereby reducing water usage by up to 25% compared to a standard 6\/3 litre dual-flush WC."
