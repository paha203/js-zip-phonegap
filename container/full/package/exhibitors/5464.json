  "description":"The UK Quality Ash Association (UKQAA) is a trade association representing the producers and users of UK ash products not only from coal fired power stations but now also from biomass combustion units.\n\nThere are two main types of coal ash produced in the UK as a result of coal combustion - they are furnace bottom ash (FBA) and pulverised fuel ash (PFA \u2013 also known as fly ash in some applications and many countries). As mentioned earlier we have now extended our remit to encompass pure biomass ash, a by-product of biomass combustion.\n\nWe promote members interests of an environmental, scientific, technical, and educational nature associated with all applications. This is achieved by sponsoring research, promoting the range of applications for ash products thus diverting ash from landfill, representation on European and UK standardisation committees, exhibitions, lunchtime presentations, etc.",
