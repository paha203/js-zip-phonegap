The Solar Electronics division was started in 1992 and markets its products via a global network of sales partners. The company is also world-renowned for its battery charging systems and welding technology.\n\nFronius continues to set new standards worldwide with new technologies and creative ideas. This is reinforced by their latest product, the Fronius Galvo, which will be exhibited at EcoBuild 2013. This is a single-phase, electrically isolated inverter that ensures the highest levels of safety. The device is designed for use in private households and small PV systems aimed at private consumption. Its wide MPP voltage range allows for a simple system layout, and the high frequency transformer makes it compatible with all module technologies. It is also designed to be open for third party system monitoring.\n\nAn innovative hinged concept makes installing the device child's play. The integrated energy management function allows for optimum private consumption. The device can be used all over the world. Production is planned to start in the middle of 2013.",
