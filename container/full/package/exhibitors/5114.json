      "description":"In all solar heating systems, there is a horizontal heating tank combined with the collector or an independent vertical solar heating boiler where the heating and domestic water is heated. The water which keeps circling between the collectors and the heating tank transfers its temperature to the system in these places and provides the required heating.\n\nAyvaz is able to provide the most appropriate boiler-flex application from the cage coiling to the   \nselection of correct fittings type and length to the tank and boiler manufacturers. \n\nPlease apply our the sales team for your special boiler-flex designs.\n\nBoiler-flex applications prevent numerous problems that the tank or boiler manufacturers face, because of the use of rigid pipes in their production.     \n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022\tCorrugated structure of the hose provides almost doubled surface area in comparison with rigid pipe applications. Greater surface area means better heat transfer capacity and higher efficiency.\n\u2022\tBoiler-flex systems are economical, energy saving applications. \n\u2022\tHose corrugations keep moving as a result of constant thermal expansion and compression, this movement prevents the lime and residue formation on the hose surface and provides longer service life.\n\u2022\tStainless steel (AISI 316L) hose is suitable for drinking water application and highly resistant to corrosion.\n\u2022\tWith the help of flexibility and low bending radius, the hose can be formed in any form required for various applications."

      "description":"Advantages:\n\n\u2022\tPyrogel XT which is derived from world\u2019s lightest insulation material called Aerogel with low \u03bb value (0.02 W\/mK) and is suitable for a wide temperature range, from -40\u00b0C up to +650 \u00b0C.\n\u2022\tLow thickness of the insulation material (5mm) reduces the external diameter of the hose and provides a relief on the transportation and the logistics area up to 66 %.\n\u2022\tEasily separable compact design requires no additional pipe support during the installation that shortens the installation time and makes it quicker and easier.\n\u2022\tThe UV cover that is applied on the insulation externally prevents the negative effects of the sun and protects the hose against the damages of the birds and other hazardous species"
