In addition we import and manufacture AB Chance products for use with the utility industries nationwide.  \n\nOur unique hand held drivers install the 60mm light and 60mm round screw piles with little or no disturbance to the surrounding area. \n\nThe Advantages of Screw Piles include:\n  1)\tSpeed of installation \u2013 often 10 minutes per pile up to 6 metres long \n  2) \tNo wet trades \u2013 concrete is not used except for form ground beams or grout \n\tpiles into existing foundations \n  3) \tPiles can accept full load immediately after installation \n  4) \tMonitoring of installation torque accurately indicates capacity \u2013 problems will \n\tshow up on installation \n  5) \tAs screw piles can be removed very easily they are well suited to temporary \n\tuses \n  6) \tAnchors can be supplied galvanised or fitted with cathodic protection for \n\taggressive soil or marine applications \n  7) \tScrew anchors can be installed at any angle to suit the load \n  8) \tA wide range of terminations is available to suit tension compression and \n\tcombination loads\n\nOur associated company, Autoguide, designs and manufactures screw pile installation equipment with torque ratings up to 250kNm.  No other manufacturer offers both pile production and installation equipment under one roof, which has significant advantages for the installer\/contractor.\n\nTo complement to 60R range we also have a conical extension which are in regular use for wind turbine foundations, installation typically taking less than 1 hour for the complete operation.\n\nScrew piles have significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional mass concrete, requiring little or no initial excavation, having accurately measured capacity and being easily removed if necessary.",
