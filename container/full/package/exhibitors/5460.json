      "description":"This unique product is the first in a whole range of products currently being developed for use within the structures of buildings in the UK.  Designed specifically for the UK construction industry, and taking into account UK building regulations and construction methods, it provides a solution for bat roosting within buildings that satisfies both the ecological and construction requirements.  Measuring 420mm wide by 440mm high and 68mm deep (main roosting area), it fits within a minimum 75mm cavity.  The sloping entrance is 170mm front to back which brings the leading edge to the front of the face brickwork in place of two normal metric size bricks.  Internally there are varying sizes of crevices, creating warmer and cooler areas and multiple roosting opportunties with an overall surface roosting area of over 4000 cm2.\n\nAs well as these ecological benefits, the slim design means that the visual impact on the face of the building is minimal.  By using the DPC and lintel supplied with each roost you can just continue to build with whatever face materials you are using on the project, and all you will see when it is installed is a two-brick 'letterbox' opening."
