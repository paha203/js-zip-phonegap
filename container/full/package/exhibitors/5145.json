OWL products can simply monitor electricity consumption, or provide the homeowner with total visibility of their solar PV generation and export.  3 phase monitoring allows the large domestic or light commercial user total visibility of their consumption.  \nMost of us dread setting up our heating controls and often give up.  Through a simple set up wizard and intuitive interface, the OWL Intuition heating management system can be set up in 10 minutes.  Intuition optimises your heating based on weather conditions and inside temperatures.  It automatically detects home occupation to minimise energy use. \n\n\u201cConserving energy without sacrificing comfort\u201d is what OWL Intuition is all about - a comprehensive home energy management system at a price point that is outstanding value for money, with possible energy savings of up to 25%.",
