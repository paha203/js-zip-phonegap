  "description":"LA CHANVRIERE DE L\u2019AUBE (LCDA) is the largest hemp factory in Europe. \nEvery year, we decorticate 35-40.000 tons of hemp straw, provided by 300 farmers who grow 5000 hectares of hemp. \nWhile the fibres issued from this mechanical process are dedicated to the paper industry, a large part of the woody core particles (hemp shives)of the plant are specially prepared for the building industry, and marketed under the brand name KANABAT (delivered in 20kg compressed bales). \nWhen mixed with the special lime binders already marketed in the UK, KANABAT is suitable for the creation of insulating walls, insulating layers of floors and roofs, as well as insulating and decorating plasters. \nWe exhibit at ECOBUILD 2013 in order to meet people interested in hemp building construction, wholesalers or retailers of environmental products, as well as builders' merchants.",
