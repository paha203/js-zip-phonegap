      "description":"DDS-CAD PV enables the planning of PV systems for a number of applications. Whether roof, fa\u00e7ade, or ground mounted, the system can be planned and visualized in 3D. The sun\u2019s position can be simulated on-site enabling the modelling of shadows of surrounding objects. For presentation purposes, simulations can be animated as an image or movie sequence.\n\nWith the fully integrated plug-in, Polysun Inside, DDS-CAD PV is able to make yield calculations based on global weather data from over 8,500 weather stations. The plug-in also offers an automatic inverter mapping as well as a comprehensive module and inverter database."

      "description":"DDS-CAD MEP is an advanced Building Information Modelling (BIM) tool for the design and documentation of electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems for buildings. It is a stand-alone system, rather than an add-on product which relies on a 3rd party CAD system like many other products on the market. \n\nUnlike many other competing solutions, DDS-CAD MEP is not a one-size-fits-all product. It is available in many different configurations and can be tailored to meet both your current and future requirements.\n\nDDS-CAD MEP is the most powerful, productive tool for creating building services design and documentation for buildings."
