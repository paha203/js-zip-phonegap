      "description":"Portland Basebed, also known as Bestbed, is the finest quality Portland Stone with a close pore structure and little shell. The stone is slightly less durable than Whitbed or Roach, and therefore may not be appropriate if a long life is required as a general paving stone, or in areas of very high exposure. Although originally used primarily as a monumental stone and carving stone, it has more recently been specified on high quality, prestigious office developments and used extensively for flooring.\n\nShell Content: Clean Basebed - small grey shell fragments. Some recent production has higher concentration of shells.~\n\nShell Distribution: The shell fragments are randomly distributed across the stone. Some areas in the quarry have yielded cross bedding.\n\nTexture: Bowers Basebed has a tight texture but some of the recent production is a little courser than previously extracted.\n\nColour: Typical Portland colour, creamy\/white. The shell concentrations and texture variation can give it slightly deeper tones."

      "description":"The Portland Whitbed is a fine grained limestone containing shell fragments distributed randomly and in bands throughout its mass. It is the traditional general building stone, being both extremely durable and able to be used for intricate masonry.\n\nShell Content: Typical Whitbed - a mixture of grey and white, large and small shells and shell fragments.\n\nShell Distribution: The shells are randomly distributed with the bedding being predominantly horizontal.\n\nTexture: Bowers Whitbed has a natural granular texture, with voids associated with the shells in bands and randomly distributed across the stones.\n\nColour: Typical Portland colour, creamy\/white, although the texture can give it slightly deeper tones."

      "description":"Portland Roach stone is a cavernous, shelly, oolitic limestone which, because of the high shell content, has a colour closer to grey\/creamy white rather than the creamy white of the other Portland Limestones. It is a very hard and extremely durable material and is therefore ideally suited to exposed sites. The pronounced shell structure has also encouraged its use as decorative flooring or cladding panels.\n\nShell Content: Shelly Roach containing large grey shell fragments. The shells include Turreted Gastropods (Portland Screws) as well as large clams.\n\nShell Distribution: The shelliest sections of Roach tend to be towards the middle of the blocks.\n\nTexture: The large Turreted Gastropods and clam shells are associated with voids. Some of the voids can be in excess of 50mm long. The stone's texture in between the voids is often tight and dense.\n\nColour: Typical Portland colour - creamy\/white, although the large concentrations of grey shells can darken the overall colour."

The shells are mainly large thin clams up to 100mm long laid parallel to the bedding.\n\nShell Distribution: The shells are randomly distributed across the stone, but due to the large clam shells, some banding is evident particularly in larger slabs.\n\nTexture: The large clam shells are associated with voids.
