      "description":"Aluminium & PVC Compined Flexible Air Duct\n\nCOMBIAFS is produced from multi-layer aluminium & polyester strengthened with high tension steel spring wire, covered with a PVC layer. COMBIAFS is recommended for discharging welding fumes (where high mechanical resistance is required), low and medium pressure heating, cooling and air conditioning systems.\n\nCOMBIAFS is more effective against condensation than a standard non-insulated aluminium flexible air duct. To maintain indoor air quality at a certain level, preventing condensation is important. Accumulation of water on the duct surface arising from condensation leads to problems such as mold growth and corrosion, which would cause serious health problems and deformation of building materials and components.\n\nIn order to prevent condensation the surface temperature of the duct shall be kept higher than the dew point of the air surrounding it. A PVC layer on the outer surface of COMBIAFS acts as an insulation which makes the duct more impermeable to water and keeps surface temperature higher.\n\nPunctures and tears could also lead to condensation and air leaks. Prevention from such deformations is achieved by adding a PVC layer which maintains more mechanical resistance than aluminum flexible air duct.\n\nCOMBIAFS is elastic and flexible. It can be easily fitted to circular, oval, or rectangular connectors. \n\nThe dimensions, tolerances and mechanical resistance of COMBIAFS are tested, classified & certified according to EN 13180 standard."
