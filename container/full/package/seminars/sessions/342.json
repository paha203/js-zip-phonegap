  "description":"Cities have developed resource consumption and waste disposal habits that show little concern for the consequences. The larger and the richer the city, the more it tends to draw on nature&rsquo;s bounty from across the world rather than its own local hinterland. Human impacts on the world&rsquo;s ecosystems and landscapes are dominated by the ecological footprints of cities which now stretch across much of the Earth. They can be hundreds of times larger than the cities themselves. In an urbanising world, cities need to rapidly switch to renewable energy and to actively help restore damaged ecosystems. Herbert Girardet, Regenerative Cities. Written for the World Future Council and HafenCity    University Hamburg (HCU) Commission on Cities and Climate Change.",
