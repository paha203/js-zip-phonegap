  "description":"Criticism of the Retrofit for the Future programme has tended to focus on costs and the extent to which targets can be achieved. The National Housing Federation&rsquo;s guide, Managing the Assets suggests that reducing carbon emission by 60% costs half that of the 80% target, and is more appropriate when decarbonisation of the electricity grid and other factors such as replacement are taken into account. This seminar will look at what can be achieved at an affordable cost.",
