  "description":"Building Regulations are a recognised instrument for achieving performance targets and have delivered improved standards over the years. The anticipated changes to Part L&nbsp; expected in 2013 (and beyond) appear to be the most challenging&nbsp; in terms of energy and carbon standards for both new build and refurbished buildings. This seminar will explore a series of questions - How will any revisions to Part L be delivered and overseen? What are the implications for costs? What are the implications of the consultation on the Future of Building Control?",
