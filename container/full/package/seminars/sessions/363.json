  "description":"IMPACT integrates life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and building information modelling. IMPACT is a specification and database for software developers to incorporate into their tools to enable consistent life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). IMPACT compliant tools work by allowing the user to attribute environmental and cost information to the BIM, to generate results for analysis and optimisation. The first to release IMPACT compliant software tools will be IES &ndash; through their Virtual Environment building simulation software. For more information on the IMPACT project visit www.IMPACTwba.com.",
