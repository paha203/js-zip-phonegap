  "description":"Cities - rural villages in the beginning - have been in existence for only about ten thousand years, and then, for most of the ensuing time for only a very small percentage of the population...in creating them we have carelessly left out part of the environment vital to the full potential development of the human mind....frequent exposure to the natural world improves mental health, it offers a deep sense of inner peace and, in many ways we have only begun to understand by scientific reason, it improves the quality of life. Edward O. Wilson, Foreword to 'Biophilic Cities'",
