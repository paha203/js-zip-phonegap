  "description":"This seminar is concerned with making improvements to the thermal performance of traditional windows and solid walls. In terms of windows, refurbishment tends to presume window replacement, but this may not be the best option. For solid walls, there is some evidence to suggest that current assessment methods for predicting moisture problems and quantifying heat loss are inadequate which can lead to an altered understanding of the performance of these walls when retrofitting.",
