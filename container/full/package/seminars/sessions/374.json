  "description":"The Government&rsquo;s flagship retrofit policy, Green Deal, faces a number of challenges; scepticism that there will be sufficient customer appeal for large scale take-up, a concern over a lack of industry experience and delivery capacity, and potential marginalisation of the SME supply chain. Will Green Deal be the stimulus needed to kick-start a nationwide UK low carbon retrofit programme and make a major contribution to 2050 targets, or will the opportunity for a truly local, sustainable and highly successful retrofit revolution be missed? &nbsp;Join the debate as we hear a range of perspectives from some of the UK&rsquo;s leading retrofit experts.",
