  "description":"There are over 6 million traditional buildings (defined as pre-1919 solid wall and with moisture permeable fabric) in the UK including almost a quarter of the existing housing stock, most of which is still going to be with us in 2050. Until recently there was little distinction between the way traditional and modern buildings were assessed and treated, but it is now understood that a distinct approach is required. &nbsp;This seminar considers the state of knowledge in regard to traditional buildings as well as possible solutions. &nbsp;",
