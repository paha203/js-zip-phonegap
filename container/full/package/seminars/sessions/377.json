  "description":"Emerging evidence suggests a gap between predicted and actual energy performance of retrofitted buildings. This has implications for meeting the UK&rsquo;s carbon reduction targets and the wider UK energy requirements and provision. This seminar will explore the causes of the &lsquo;retrofit performance gap&rsquo; in relation to housing by looking at discrepancies which may be built in at the design stage, lack of performance occurring at the construction stage and changes through use at the operational stage.&nbsp;",
