  "description":"While the arguments for retrofitting individual buildings are well rehearsed there are many more opportunities for carbon savings at the neighbourhood level. Measures impractical at an individual building scale can be deployed over neighbourhoods. It enables all the resources coming into and going out of communities to be looked at as one so that waste arisings from one part can be reused for another. It enables everyone, other than the pioneers and early adopters, to be engaged so that energy savings are not lost on increases in use. It also maximises the economic and regeneration potential of retrofit.",
