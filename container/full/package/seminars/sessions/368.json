  "description":"Cities are responsible for some 70% of global carbon emissions and 75% of global energy consumption, and by 2050 70% of the world&rsquo;s population will live in cities. The challenge for urban policymakers is to develop the knowledge and capacity to understand more sustainable ways of generating and using energy and resources and incorporate this into the existing built environment, and the lives of the people who live in it. The session will discuss emerging insights from the EPSRC RETROFIT 2050 project http:\/\/www.retrofit2050.org.uk which seeks to deliver a step change in current knowledge and capacity for urban sustainability and illuminate realistic social and technological options for the systemic retrofitting of core UK city-regions.&nbsp;",
