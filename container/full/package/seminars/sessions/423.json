  "description":"We are all striving to build more energy efficient buildings and environmental assessment systems have been developed to provide performance ratings. However there are questions which need to be considered if we are to achieve truly sustainable buildings with longevity: Are the rating systems measuring the right things? Is the current rating tool process too expensive for tool few benefits? &nbsp;Is there a proven green premium (or a brown discount) &ndash; for certified buildings and if so what is it? Is a green certified building better because it is green &ndash; or because this is necessary for a building to be considered as Grade A space?",
