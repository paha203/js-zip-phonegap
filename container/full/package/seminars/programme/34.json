  "description":"Cutting carbon emissions from commercial buildings is a particular challenge because of the business model applicable to this sector. Traditionally landlords have been reluctant to invest in more sustainable buildings because of perceptions there is no uplift in residual or rental values and tenants have been reluctant to pay more for a greener building. The picture is slowly changing, CSR is creating a market for green commercial property and occupiers are increasingly specifying a minimum environmental assessment rating. Landlords and occupiers are adapting a more long term approach to built environment assets and are increasingly collaborating with green leases to cut energy use. This session explores these issues.",
