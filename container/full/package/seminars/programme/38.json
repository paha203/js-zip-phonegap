  "description":"All publicly funded projects must operate at Level 2 BIM by 2016, and most privately funded projects are expected to follow suit. &ldquo;This information model can be used to inform the decision-making process and answer questions throughout the entire project lifecycle. One BIM input can give us many valuable outputs. In order for this process to be effectively implemented, however, it needs to be undertaken in a truly collaborative environment (with iterative feedback loops), and here lies the real challenge.&rdquo; David Philp, Head of BIM Implementation, Cabinet Office.&nbsp;",
