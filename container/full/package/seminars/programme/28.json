  "description":"Improving the energy efficiency of all buildings is critical if the built environment is to make a significant contribution to cutting carbon emissions.&nbsp; Equally important is a low energy design approach for new-build.&nbsp; However, the performance gap persists (energy use is consistently higher than predicted). This stream tackles the interconnected issues of the performance gap; post-occupancy evaluation; building performance evaluation; and the Soft Landings programme which the Government is rolling out in 2016 to ensure that occupiers have an opportunity to fully understand how a building works in a &ldquo;handover&rdquo; period post commissioning.",
