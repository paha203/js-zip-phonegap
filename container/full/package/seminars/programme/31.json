  "description":"Passivhaus is a low energy standard that relies on an extremely efficient envelope to keep annual heat energy demand below 15kWh\/m2 per year. It is a tried and tested approach that is becoming increasingly popular in the UK as Passivhaus buildings perform close to design predictions and are comfortable for occupiers too. Achieving Passivhaus certification relies on careful building design and forensic attention to detail during construction. This seminar stream examines why Passivhaus is a standard worth aiming for and the design and technical strategies needed to achieve it. The session also explores how Passivhaus interfaces with UK specific regulations and how it can be used on large projects.",
