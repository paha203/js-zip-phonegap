  "description":"It is estimated that at least 70% of the UK&rsquo;s housing stock likely to exist in 2050 has already been built. Three-quarters of these existing dwellings were built before 1975 with 25% built before 1919. Furthermore 65% of houses are owner-occupied. Buildings emit 44% of the UK&rsquo;s entire greenhouse gases with 27% coming from homes and 17% from other buildings. The Climate Change Act required that an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases on 1990 levels is achieved by 2050 with 30% achieved by 2020. The EU 2050 Building Sector targets require an 88-91% reduction on 1990 levels by 2050. The only way these targets can be met is by refurbishing and retrofitting buildings on an individual, neighbourhood and city wide scale.",
