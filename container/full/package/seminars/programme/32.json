  "description":"As building regulations drive down the amount of carbon generated from heating, cooling and lighting buildings, the carbon embodied in the materials from which these are constructed becomes more significant. Understanding what makes up the whole life carbon footprint of buildings is a complex subject. What are the relevant standards to apply? How should whole life carbon be measured so that like for like comparisons can be made? How do we design effectively for both construction and deconstruction? To what extent is design intent matched by achievable outcomes? How does user behaviour influence overall carbon use? Whole life carbon poses many questions and needs to be understood by all engaged with design in the built environment.",
