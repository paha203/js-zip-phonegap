  "content":"<h2>Practical Installer<\/h2>\n<p>Plumb Center returns with its hugely popular Practical Installer showcase, which demonstrates the installation and operation of working renewable and energy-efficient products in a retro-fit environment &ndash; complete with typical Green Deal energy saving and funding calculations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, you will see real life &lsquo;before and after&rsquo; scenarios highlighting the impact on a property&rsquo;s energy efficiency - and the economic benefits - resulting from the installation of specific products. The industry&rsquo;s leading manufacturers will come together once again to give physical demonstrations and installation advice of solar thermal and heat pumps and combine them with key aspects of a Green Deal assessment and the domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).<\/p>"
